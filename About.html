                <p class="talha-A-ach">Conducting Speed Programming Event three times, which involves a dynamic and fast-paced competition where participants race against the clock to solve challenging coding problems. This one-time event requires detailed planning and coordination to ensure smooth execution. Organizers must curate a set of diverse and engaging problems that test various aspects of programming skills, from algorithmic thinking to debugging. The event kicks off with an introductory briefing, outlining the rules and judging criteria, followed by the coding challenge where participants work intensely within a fixed time limit. Real-time progress tracking and a robust submission system are essential to manage and evaluate the solutions efficiently.</p>
